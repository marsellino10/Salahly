# Salahly Technician FAQ

## Getting Started

### How do I register as a technician?
Open the Salahly app, choose **Technician**, and complete the registration form. You will provide your craft specialization, years of experience, primary service areas, and contact details.

### What documents do I need?
Have a clear profile photo, any licenses or certificates related to your craft, and proof of identity. Uploads are reviewed by the Salahly team before your profile goes live.

## Managing Your Profile

### How can I update my hourly rate or bio?
Go to **Profile** → **My Services**, adjust your hourly rate, bio, or years of experience, and save. Updates appear instantly for customers browsing your profile.

### Can I add or remove service areas?
Yes. In **Service Areas**, tap **Add Area** to include new neighborhoods or cities, or select an existing area to edit/remove it. Keep your service radius realistic so you can reach customers promptly.

## Portfolio & Media

### How do I upload portfolio images?
During profile setup or later under **Portfolio**, tap **Add Item**, attach up to 5 photos (JPG, PNG, or WebP, max 5MB each), add a short description, and save.

### Why was my image rejected?
Ensure the photo clearly reflects your craft, avoids watermarks, and meets size/format requirements. Blurry or unrelated images may be removed to maintain quality standards.

## Handling Requests & Offers

### How do I respond to a new service request?
You will get a notification in-app. Review the request details, then tap **Send Offer** to provide your price estimate, available times, and any notes.

### Can I edit or withdraw an offer?
Yes. Until a customer accepts, you can edit the offer to adjust pricing or availability. To withdraw, open the offer and select **Withdraw Offer**.

## Availability & Scheduling

### How do I mark myself unavailable?
Set your availability in **Calendar** → **Manage Availability**. Block out dates or time slots when you are not accepting bookings.

### Do customers see my schedule?
Customers see your available slots only after they select you for an offer. Keep your calendar updated to avoid conflicts.

## Payments & Ratings

### When do I get paid?
Payments are processed after job completion and customer confirmation. Cash-on-completion is also supported in selected regions—ensure the customer agrees beforehand.

### How can I improve my rating?
Deliver quality service, arrive on time, communicate clearly with customers, and keep your profile updated. Encourage satisfied customers to leave feedback.
